# Brainnet EEG

Welcome to the Brainnet EEG repository! This project is dedicated to processing EEG (Electroencephalography) data collected from various studies and development initiatives. Our primary focus includes analysis and application development for music therapy, the Uvic-Malawi Malaria study, dementia analysis through the Laurel Place Study, and several EEG development projects aimed at enhancing EEG data acquisition and analysis.

## Branches Overview

- **Music Therapy Study**: Focuses on processing and analyzing EEG data collected from music therapy sessions to understand its impact on brain activity.
- **Uvic-Malawi Malaria Study**: Dedicated to analyzing EEG data for insights into the effects of malaria on brain activity, specifically in the context of a study conducted in Malawi.
- **Laurel Place Study**: Contains two main focuses:
  - **Dementia Analysis**: Analyzing EEG data to study dementia and its progression.
  - **MMSE Prediction**: Developing models to predict the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score based on EEG data.
- **EEG Devs**: A branch containing various development projects related to EEG processing and equipment, including:
  - **EEG Denoiser**: Developing algorithms for noise reduction in EEG data.
  - **BVS Stimulus Sequence Development**: Creating stimulus sequences for brain visual systems.
  - **EEG Latency Measurement**: Tools and techniques for measuring latency in EEG data.
  - **Custom EEG Acquisition Firmware**: Firmware development for custom EEG data acquisition systems.
  - **Python FTDI Device Checker**: A utility for checking and managing FTDI devices used in EEG data acquisition.
